Hi everyone. This is the hello world post of this blog. This is the blog
of Raffael Schmid and I will post stuff about coding, system
administrating and other geeky stuff.

About me... I'm an employee at Nine Internet Solutions AG where I first
started as an "System Administrator". But right from the start I was
developing stuff and learned Ruby (on Rails). So my job description
changed "Web Software Developer", finally.

This blog is hosted on [github-pages](http://pages.github.com/) and
powered by [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).
